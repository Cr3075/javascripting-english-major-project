// 1. Write a program so that when you reload your page, it asks for a number and prints all the numbers from 1 to it, including it.

// 2. Building on that program, create it so that instead of printing the number, it prints something like:

// This is the #response div.
// 1 is odd.
// 2 is even.
// 3 is odd.

// 3. Building on the previous program, have it print the same, except without that ugly “This is the #response div.” line.

// 4. Write down what seem to be common mistakes you are making. Are you forgetting to add some aspect of the JavaScript syntax?
